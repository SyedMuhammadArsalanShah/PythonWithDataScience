### Part 2: Conditional Statements

11. **Write a Python program that takes a number as input and checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero.**

12. **Write a Python program to find the largest of three numbers entered by the user.**

13. **Write a Python program to check whether a given year is a leap year.**

14. **Write a Python program that accepts two numbers from the user and prints whether the first is divisible by the second.**

15. **Write a Python program that asks the user to input a number and checks if it is an even or odd number.**

17. **Write a Python program to find if a number is prime or not.**

18. **Write a Python program that takes an integer input and prints its corresponding day of the week (e.g., 1 for Monday, 7 for Sunday).**

19. **Write a Python program to check whether a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.**

20. **Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is a perfect number (sum of divisors equals the number itself).**
